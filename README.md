## Dining Philosophers Problem Implementation

This project was developed as part of a distributed software coursework at Telecom Paris. It tackles the classic Dining Philosophers Problem using multiple approaches. The implementation includes three distinct versions: two running on servers communicating with a client—one using RMI, another using sockets—and a standalone local implementation.

### Project Structure

- **RMI Version**: Implements the Dining Philosophers Problem using Remote Method Invocation (RMI) for distributed computing.
- **Socket Version**: Utilizes socket programming to simulate the Dining Philosophers Problem across networked servers and a client.
- **Local Version**: A standalone implementation running locally on a single machine.

### Getting Started

Refer to the individual README files provided in each folder for detailed instructions on setting up and running each version of the program.
